This Discord Bot keeps users updated on the daily headlines of the day. The bot leverages Google's News API which provides developers access to the headlines from a variety of sources. 

The bot automatically sends a message every 24 hours at 8 AM local time to give users an update of the news occuring across the world. Furthermore, the bot also provides users with options to delve into headlines for more specific categories that the Google API provides, through the use of Discord Reactions.
